# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation CCEI 2023

## Project Overview

This project is the outcome of our participation in the **China College Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition (CCEI 2023)**. Our team designed and implemented a **Autonomous Vehicle Simulation System**, which can intelligently assess road conditions and make driving decisions based on simulated environments. The project demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous driving technology and highlights the potential of intelligent transportation systems.

## Project Objectives

- **Intelligent Decision Making**: The system simulates a vehicle that can intelligently assess road conditions and make driving decisions using built-in sensors and algorithms.
- **Road Condition Recognition**: The vehicle can automatically adjust its behavior based on various road conditions, such as obstacles, traffic signs, and other environmental factors.
- **Autonomous Driving Simulation**: The project models the behavior of an autonomous vehicle within a controlled simulation environment to evaluate its decision-making algorithms.

## Features

- **Real-time Road Condition Assessment**: The vehicle continuously monitors its surroundings and makes decisions in real-time based on predefined road scenarios.
- **Driving Decision Algorithms**: Implemented algorithms for safe and efficient driving decisions, including stopping, turning, or accelerating, depending on the road environment.
- **Simulation Environment**: The project runs in a simulated environment, mimicking real-world driving scenarios with varying road conditions and obstacles.

## Key Technologies

- **Digital Circuits**: The project is based on digital circuits, including logic gates and flip-flops, to simulate vehicle behavior and decision-making processes.
- **Simulated Vehicle Model**: A simplified model of an intelligent connected vehicle that simulates sensors, road recognition, and decision-making.
- **Autonomous Driving Algorithms**: Algorithms for vehicle decision-making, including obstacle detection and traffic management, based on simulated data.
